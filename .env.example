# Local Development Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and configure as needed

# SQLite Database URL (for local development)
# This creates a local SQLite database file in the prisma directory
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# PostgreSQL URLs (only needed for Vercel/Production deployment)
# These will be automatically provided by Vercel when deploying
# DO NOT set these for local development - use SQLite instead
